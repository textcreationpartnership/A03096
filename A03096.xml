            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The fellow having thus ſaid, whether moved thereto by ſome Divine Inſtinct; or to purchaſe himſelfe a Name (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an obſcure Plebeian) or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee hoped to attaine ſome great Reward of the Prince for his diſcovery, certainely <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi> was mightily aſtoniſht.

He ſent alſo Poſts to his ſonne; which by their ſpeed prevented the rumours of what was done at Rome, and delivered to him very loving Letters from the Emperour, requiring him to haſten forthwith to <hi>Rome,</hi> for his extraordinary advancement. The meſſengers alſo told him it was his Fathers deſire hee ſhould come; but writ not himſelfe, becauſe hee knew the Emperours Letters were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. The young man utterly ignorant of his Fathers diſaſter, or of the plot againſt himſelfe, beleeved this to bee true; and though he were much troubled that his deſignes were thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, yet relying on his Fathers puiſſance, (whom hee thought to bee ſafe enough) hee
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4189:28"/>
ſet forward on his journey, and as ſoone as hee arrived in <hi>Italy,</hi> hee was ſlaine by the Emperors appoyntment. This was the end of them.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Commodus</hi> made two Pretorian Praefects, ſuppoſing it not ſafe, to delegate ſo great power to any one, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided betwixt two, might bee the weaker and leſſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. But ere long another trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon broke out againſt him in this manner.</p>
                  <p>There was one <hi>Maternus</hi> a<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Maternus</hi> a Rebell.</note> Souldier, that had committed many villanous outrages: whereupon for ſaking the camp, hee aſſociated divers Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does like himſelfe, and quickly rallied together a great Rabble of Roarers; waſting and ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Villages and Fields.

to him a farre greater number of Rogues, whom hee promiſed great rewards; and having made them Sharers with him, hee was ſo followed, that now they ſeemed not to be a packe of Theeves, but an Hoſt of men, or a full Armie. For they tooke great Cities, and breaking up Priſons every where, ſet all Priſoners and Malefactors at liberty; which all turned Souldiers, in hope of Pillage and Impunity. Thus did they ramble over all <hi>Gallia,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſacking and burning all the great Cities they tooke.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Commodus</hi> heard this, hee ſent to the Vicegerents and Governours of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, very ſharpe and minatory Letters, charging them with baſe cowardlineſſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to levie an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie

                  <p>Thus was that bloody broile extinguiſht, and the fight on both ſides ceaſed.

                  <p>When the day of that grand Solemnity was come, the Amphitheater was thronged with Spectatours.

Hee ſlew in Chaſe, Buckes, Does, and other horned Beaſts (except Bulls) not one eſcaping him: But from the Tarras he darted at Lyons, Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and other of the Nobler ſort of Beaſts, with that rare dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, as that he never threw the ſecond time, nor gave them any wound but was mortall. For when the Beaſt was rowzed, he preſently hit it in the Head or Heart, ayming at no other part of the body; ſo that as ſoone as it was ſtrucke, it fell dead. For this purpoſe, all kinde of wilde beaſts were brought farre and neere; and then did we firſt ſee thoſe, which before we admired in their pictures.

few (in compariſon of them.) All therfore having ſworn Feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him, and beene preſent at the Sacrifice, the Souldiers and Commons with Lawrell bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in their hands, conduct him ere it was Day-light, to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Pallace: whither being come, he was exceeding penſive.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4189:53"/>
For though his Life was much commended for his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate carriage, and for deeds of Armes hee were moſt famous; yet was hee farre exceeded in birth by many of the Senatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Order. Wherefore as ſoone as it was Day-light, hee went to the Senat-houſe, not ſuffering Fire to bee carryed before him, nor admitting any other Symbol of Soveraignty, till he knew the pleaſure of the Senatours: but they, when they ſaw him, did with one accord joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, ſtiling him <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and Emperor.

He had a horrible ugly countenance, and ſuch a Cyclopicall Bulk, that no Greek nor Barbarian Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was comparable to him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus ordered his affaires, he leads all his army with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage over the Bridge, and makes war upon the Germans.

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:4189:188"/>
For they had left all the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne and plaine Country, and betaken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves to the woods<note place="margin">Woods &amp; Bogs.</note> and bogs, where they skulked &amp; watched their advantage to make an irruption upon the enemy: as knowing that the trees w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> grew ſo thicke would hinder the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Darts &amp; Arrowes; and the depth of the bogs would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for the <hi>Romans</hi> that knew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not: but eaſie &amp; acceſsible to them that wel knew where they were paſſable, running daily tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row them, up to the knees.
